My name is Meg, and Iâ€™m a fibre addict.

I learned to knit as a kid from my mother and grandmother, and knit on and off though my childhood and teen years.  I really became passionate about fibre-arts when I lived in Nova Scotia for university. I have been branched out since, spending more time spinning yarn and dyeing yarn and fiber but knitting will always be my first love.

I really appreciate the strong and vibrate internet community because my access to yarn, fiber and tools was much more limited on the East Coast so I was fairly reliant on internet reviews for yarn and tools, and for knitting support.

I am interested in both academic research about knitting, having written my thesis on the the sociology of gender in knitting.  I someday hope to have the opportunity to refresh this work, and give it the time it deserves.
